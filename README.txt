Measuring-Stability-Using-the-Reflection-API

Running the Project
========================
1. Run the Runner.java file as a Java Application in your IDE
2. When the GUI is displayed, press the browse button and select a JAR file from your file system
3. Once you have selected a JAR press the Analyse button, this will display inDegree, outDegree and stability of each class in a table format

Note: The result is also displayed in the console in Eclipse, this is intended as I needed to ensure the numbers matched the result in the GUI

Main Features
=======================
This application calculates the stability of each class in a JAR file
I have also created a GUI for the user to use which functions correctly

How I done it
======================
I first created this project as a console application and used regular for loops
I then replaced all for loops with enhanced for loops having found some information while researching looping over hash maps online
I have left some of the old for loops in comment format to show this as well as providing the links I used to create the enhanced for loops

Once the application was working in the console I created a GUI
I used the "Simple Swing App with JTable File" provided on moodle as an template for my GUI

UML
=======
I created a UML containing methods and variables first(design.png)... then realised they were't suppose to be there.. so I created one without them (design(noVariablesMethods).png)
